How to process, validate homogenized files

aura-mls:
    read_mlsdata.py: takes mls data and station metadata and makes station specific mls data
    station_mlsdata.py:
        output is station data interpolated to mls grid
        for 2 cases
        # ozone = 'O3'
        # name_out = f'MLS_{scname}Interpolated_nors80_v05_original'
        and
        ozone = 'O3c'
        name_out = f'MLS_{scname}Interpolated_nors80_v05_dqa'
        needs to be run 2 times for O3 (not corrected, oroginal server data) and for O3c
        which is homogenized data
    mls_heatmap.py:
        plots heatmaps of RDif of O3 and O3c, as previous code needs to be run 2 times seperately for O3 and O3c
        # df1 = pd.read_csv(path + f'MLS_{scname}Interpolated_nors80_v05_dqa.csv')
        # Plotname = 'DQA_vs_MLS_v05'
        # ptitle = f'{scname} Homogenized - MLS (v05)'
            and
        df1 = pd.read_csv(path + f'MLS_{scname}Interpolated_nors80_v05_original.csv')
        Plotname = 'Original_vs_MLS_v05'
        ptitle = f'{scname} Non-Homogenized - MLS (v05)'
        Code prints out the x labels on the console, it needs to be adjusted in the plotting function:

        it may start from 2005 for example

    station_binneddata: makes a dataframe of all Homogenization corrections step by step.
        This data is used to make heatmaps to see the effect of each correction, also gridded to
        pressure levels.
        Only need to change station name, and sometimes files can be in csv or hdf format.
        This might need to be adjusted in the main code.

    heatmap_stepbystep:
        uses output of the previous code and makes heatmaps to see the effect of each correction.
        Code prints out the x labels on the console, it needs to be adjusted in the plotting function:
        https://github.com/denizpoyraz/o3s-dqa-homogenization/blob/3bf76b959b4c607e41e72529fe0a646f163b9aa9/aura-mls/heatmap_stepbystep.py#L45        it may start from 2005 for example
        it may start from 1996, then labels need to be changed for example


paper: historical name to process things that may go in eu paper
    calculate_km_monthly means.py: code to calculate data in each km and make monthly mean data
    uses output of main homogenization code *all_hom*nors80.*
    deseasonalize_data.py: deaseasonalize output of previous data that will be used for trend analysis
