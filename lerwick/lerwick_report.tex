\section{Lerwick Metadata Timeseries}
\label{sec:metadata}

The Lerwick ozonesonde time series started on February 1992.
Ozonesonde data were obtained from the nilu and WOUDC server and underwent quality checks through DQA homogenization
carried out by RMI. Relevant metadata values were extracted from the headers of Ames data files which were only available
2004 and onwards. The WOUDC data files are used until 2002, and nilu files have been used for afterwards. 
In cases where data was missing, the median value of the relevant data was used as a substitute.

For humidity correction, temperature (TLab), humidity (RHLab), and pressure (PLab) values from the laboratory were used.
In instances where any of these measurements were absent, climatological averages were calculated for each month,
and these values were used to fill the gaps.
Furthermore, TLab, PLab, and ULab were used for moisture correction of pump flow rates, and iB2 was applied for
background correction. Related plots can be found in Figure \ref{fig:iB2} through Figure \ref{fig:PLab}.

\section{O3S Corrections}
The code used for processing the homogenization corrections is available at \url{https://github.com/denizpoyraz/o3s-dqa-homogenization}.
\label{sec:v04}


The recommended and applied O3S-DQA corrections are summarized below.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Conversion efficiency
\item Background current
\item Pump temperature measurement
\item Pump flow rate, moistening effect
\item Pump flow efficiency at low pressures
\item Total ozone normalization: in O3S-DQA guide this correction factor is recommended to be added in the data-set,
but the normalization factor is applied.
%\item Radiosonde changes: RS80 radiosonde correction is tested but not applied yet.
\end{enumerate}


O3S-DQA corrections are applied to the raw current measured by ECC's. The raw current values are
determined from converting partial ozone values available
in the existing files to ECC current.

The pump temperature values, pump flow rate and background values (iB2) are needed
to obtain the raw current values.
The corrections applied to calculate ozone partial pressure values in the existing files, are un-corrected to
get the raw ECC current values. These corrections, applied in the Vaisala software, are:
pressure dependent background correction for SPC sondes and pump flow
efficiency correction for both SPC and ENSCI sondes. The pump flow efficiency correction table used at this stage is slightly different than
the table used for O3S-DQA pump efficiency corrections.
The correction applied for uncorrecting original pump flow efficiency can be seen in Ozone Sounding with Vaisala
Radiosonde RS41 User's Guide M211486EN, page 74 and the correction table
used for O3S-DQA can be seen in O3S-DQA Activity: Guide Lines for Homogenization of Ozone Sonde Data (Version 2.0)
at page 34.
The Ozone partial values values from the original files are shown as
'Non-homogenized' and all DQA corrections are denoted by 'DQA'
in the rest of the report.

%
\subsubsection{Conversion efficiency}
Stoichiometry correction is applied to ENSCI $1.0\%-1.0$B sondes. The other used sonde and solution content are SPC $1.0\%-1.0$B, that
do not need further correction.
%        efficiency correction is applied.

\subsubsection{Background current}
The effect of background correction on Lerwick data, using iB2, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bkg}.
    If $I_B$ exceeds $I_{B,\text{Mean}}+2\sigma_{IB}$, then $I_B$
    should be replaced by a more representative climatic value $I_{B,\text{Mean}}$, but with a
    larger uncertainty $2\sigma_{IB}$, Figure~\ref{fig:iB2}.
This correction is only valid for 2004 and onwards, as no metadata is available before 2004. For 2004 and before, mean values
are used.

\subsubsection{Pump temperature measurement}

The truest pump temperature correction is applied according to Eq.13 in the O3S-DQA Guidelines.
Until 1995-11 SPC-5A sondes, and onwards  SPC-6A and ENSCI sondes have been launched.
These periods need different corrections and the effects are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tpump}.

\subsubsection{Pump flow rate (moistening effect)}
This correction, Eq.15 of the O3S-DQA Guidelines, is applied and shown in Fig~\ref{fig:pf_ptu}.
Details of the values used for this correction are described in Sec~\ref{sec:metadata}.

%%
\subsubsection{Pump flow efficiency}
This correction, Eq.22 of the O3S-DQA Guidelines, is applied using Table 6 of the O3S-DQA Guidelines and
shown in Fig~\ref{fig:pf_eff}.
%The interpolation of the correction factors are made using the pressure. This method gives the same result as doing the interpolation using the logarithm of pressure
%and polynomial fit with an error of less than $0.03\%$.
The effect of this correction is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:pf_eff}.

\section{Comparison plots to AURA MLS v5.0}
The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), is one of the four instruments on the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura satellite.
MLS has been measuring vertical profiles of atmospheric trace gases (including
ozone), temperature, geopotential height, relative humidity,
cloud ice water content, and cloud ice water path, since its
launch in 2004. Global measurements at two fixed solar
times, noon–night, at around 01:30/13:30 LST (local solar
time) are achieved, with the number of profiles over, for example, ozonesonde sites varying between zero and six daily.
Here, the MLS v5.0 data is screened according
to the v5.0 Level 2 MLS Data Quality document, and have compared the satellite overpass measurements
with coincident ozonesonde profiles at Ny-Aalesund. Because
there are multiple profiles crossing at a fixed time,
the profile closest in distance is used for the validation. Both
the noon and night overpasses have been used, as we did
not find significant differences between them.
The homogenized (DQA) and non-homogenized  Lerwick data compared with the MLS data are compared
and shown in figures between
\ref{fig:niwav04} and \ref{fig:dqav04_rs80}.

%    \section{Temporal evolution of the vertical ozone concentrations}
%    We calculate vertically resolved ozone trends from the surface to around 30 km for
%2000-2020, characterised by stratospheric ozone depletion and recovery, respectively.
%    The implemented statistical model to calculate trends is the Long-term Ozone Trends and Uncertainties
%    in the Stratosphere (LOTUS) multiple linear regression (MLR) model. This model
%uses an independent linear trend (ILT) method as trend term,
%which is based on two different, independent, trends to describe the ozone decrease until 1997 (ODS increase) and
%the slow ozone increase since the early 2000s (after the
%turnaround in ODS concentrations). Additionally, the
%LOTUS regression includes two orthogonal components of
%the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO), the 10.7 cm solar radio flux, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO),
%and the aerosol optical depth (AOD). As time-series of Ny-Aalesund only starts at 1992, only the post trends are considered.
%    Using only one linear trend and other predictors will be checked and used extensively for a more detailed report.
%    The trends using post linear term is shown in  Fig.\ref{fig:trend1}.
