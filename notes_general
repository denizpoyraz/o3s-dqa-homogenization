Data update at least until end of 2022 for the paper

Lauder: check richards files

Lerwick: contacted station PI

Madrid: downloading latest files from WOUDC -> downloaded-> metadata is available in recent WOUDC files,
but first asked to station PI for an updated excel file. If they can provide me I will use that file, otherwise convert the woudc ones myself
    * data proccessing-> done, check heatmaps
    *heatmaps are fine-> good
    * dates :1996-01

Ny-Aalesund: new files from nilu, dqa hom. done -> but reading ames file using nappy and adding those files to the main metada
was not made in a good way. If you have the time, fix merging all the data-sets.
    * making binned data to check heatmaps
    *check heatmaps: ->seems all fine
    * data missing between 22/04 and 23/01
    * dates :1992-01


Scoresbysund: 2022 downloaded from nilu
    *check conversion to po3 to current for dates after 2015/12/24
    it seems conversion correction from ensci1010 to spc1010 is already applied-> this was already known.
       convert po3 to current using old ames/nilu reader and organize and calculate current
       *new heatmaps are checked all seem fine
       * dates :1991-11


Sodankyla: 2022 downloaded
    * running the homogenization code
    * heatmaps are fine
           * dates :1991-11

     #####problem with the data, saw starnge values 20070131, check other dates!!!


Uccle: copied from server to local pc, do the processing
    * update and check heatmaps-> all done
    *mls data is done

Valentia:
    *2022 downloaded, homogenization done
    * heatmaps, check-> done look fine

** all files apart from lerwick and lauder transfreed to ftp hegiftom

**** Things to do for the paper:
1) updating the time series-> done
2) Comparing to MLS-> almost
3) Trying LOTUS regression, checking the effect of different proxies-> started
4) maybe checking total ozone values with th ones got from Ryan from satellites


Extras:
* New LOTUS is installed
* Check predictors, uccle code and making monthly means etc...

For trend analysis:
* first calculate km means
* then monthly means
* start with uccle
* all done -> next step is to deasasonolize the data and test LOTUS MLR
* but you have to update predictor, but first use the current predictors in new lotus mlr model

check Lerwicj PTU values and humidity correction values
also check the latter for other stations> fixed
-> next time make lerwick heatmaps and mls comparisons
